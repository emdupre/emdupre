### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford University working between the [Poldrack](https://poldracklab.stanford.edu/) and [Linderman](https://web.stanford.edu/~swl1/) labs. My current research focuses on improving inferences we can draw from high-dimensional, naturalistic datasets through alignment. 

I'm an open science enthusiast, particularly in developing tools and methods that make it easier to do open and reproducible work. I've contributed to several projects across the open neuroimaging ecosystem including [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org), [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io), and [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.org).
