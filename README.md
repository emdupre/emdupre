### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate in neuroscience at McGill University working in the [@neurodatascience](https://github.com/neurodatascience/) lab. My current research focuses on improving inferences we can draw from high-dimensional, naturalistic datasets through alignment. 

I'm an open science enthusiast, particularly in developing tools and methods that make it easier to do open and reproducible work. I've contributed to several projects across the open neuroimaging ecosystem including [BIDS](http://bids.neuroimaging.io), [fMRIPrep](https://fmriprep.org), [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io), and [tedana](https://tedana.readthedocs.org).

I've also been involved in several organizations promoting open practices including [Mozilla Open Leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/open-leadership-events/vault/open-leaders/) and the [OHBM Open Science SIG](https://ossig.netlify.app).
