### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al working in [the SIMEXP lab](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/).
My current research focuses on applying functional alignment techniques to overcome distribution shifts in high-dimensional, naturalistic datasets.

I'm an open science enthusiast, particularly in developing tools and methods that make it easier to do open and reproducible work.
I've contributed to several projects across the open neuroimaging ecosystem, including currently serving as a core contributor to [nilearn](http://nilearn.github.io).
